    In the early 1900â€™s, Jews were being persecuted for their beliefs. They were 
not resisting at first, but near the end of a certain war, they did. That war was the Second World War. The main person persecuting them was Adof Hitler. The party with these racial ideologies are called the Nazi Party.
There were other groups being persecuted as well, and some non persecuted 
groups resisting the German authorities of that time. Another persecuted group was the Gypsies (Jewish Resistance). They also resisted because of how they were being treated. Some explanations of these events will be explained in this article, along with a few individuals that were big in the resistance of the Nazi Regime. The topics will consist of: Overall Resistance Efforts, which consist of both non-Jewish and Jewish resistance efforts; the last topic will be about a major historical character, who was a Nazi, but saved thousands of Jewish Humans (Oskar Schindler). His name was Oskar Schindler (Oskar Schindler).
